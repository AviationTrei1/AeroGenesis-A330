If you are looking for fuselage/livery paintkits:

You can use any Paintkit available for the LR A330 - since it's the same fuselage this shouldn't be a problem. Do to Copyright we cannot just add one from the web to the repo.
And since we are all busy no one would make a new (same) one for us to distribute.
